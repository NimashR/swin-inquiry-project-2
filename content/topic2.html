        <h1>What are Cookies and Sessions?</h1>

        <p> Cookies and sessions are actually different things, a cookie is a text file that is stored client side (on the user's web browser) so the site and browser can recognize previous uses of a site. Cookies were invented to make user's experience on the internet more convenient. This differs to a Session as a session is data of the website user, stored on the website's server, a session is usually terminated after 30 minutes or when the tab is closed.</p>

        <h1>What are typical uses of a Cookie and a Session?</h1>
        <p>A common use of cookies is usernames and passwords, the browser utilizes cookies to remember a past user's username and password so they dont have to type it in themselves. This is different to a session as an example of a session could be a shopping basket. Most sites keep what is in your shopping basket for the purpose of convenience so if you add eggs to your basket, then open a new tab, the website will recognise that this is the session as the first tab and will use the session information to make eggs in the shopping basket of the second tab. Sessions typically timeout within 30 minutes so the server does not become full with data that is no longer needed by users. </p>
