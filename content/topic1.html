                <h3>Creation of Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    "Persistent client state objects" nicknamed by the creator as "Cookies" were first created in 1994 by a web browser programmer 
                    named Lou Montuili.
                    He worked at Netscape, which was the most popular web browser back in the day. 
                    He invented cookies with the purpose in mind of making the shopping experience on online e-commerce sites much easier 
                    for the customers, by allowing them to store their selected items in a virtual shopping cart. 
                    The following year, he applied for the patent for his newfound Cookie technology.

                    <p>
                        The public first knew about this through an article in "The Financial Times" in which the title was, 
                        "This Bug in Your PC Is a Smart Cookie". 
                        While it was interesting technology, 
                        the tracking of an individual user through new methods was alarming for some people.
                        This later became a turning point for online user privacy, which was to try to reduce the overall data collected from online users.

                <!--Difference between First and Third party cookies-->
                <h3>First-party Cokies Vs Third-party Cookies</h3>

                <p>Before going any further, we should be aware of the two types of cookies which are based on who that cookies belong. 
                    These two are: First-party and Third-party cookies. The below table will make it easier to identify between the two.
                </p>    

                <table class="t1">
                    
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                         <th class="t1" scope="col">...</th>
                         <th class="t1" scope="col">First-party</th> 
                         <th class="t1" scope="col">Third-party</th>
                        </tr>
                        </thead>
                   <tbody>
                    <tr>
                      <th scope="row" class="t1">Owner</th>
                      <td class="t1">Owner of the Website</td>
                      <td class="t1">A Third-party (Other than the owner)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <th scope="row" class="t1">Main Purpose</th>
                      <td class="t1">Managing the browsing session</td>
                      <td class="t1">Tracking the activity of user </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                       <th scope="row" class="t1"> Service</th>
                       <td class="t1">Enabling a good browsing experience</td>
                       <td class="t1">Targeted Online Advertising</td>
                    </tr>
                   </tbody>
                </table>
                

                <p>As you can see, the use of third-party cookies was not optional. 
                    Due to this, two years later in 1997, Internet Engineering Task Force 
                    set a standard for cookies which was not on the supporting side of Third-party Cookies.
                </p>

                <h3>Struggle against Third-party Cookies</h3>

                <p>As you might expect advertising companies started abusing cookie technology to gather as much user 
                    data and suggest personalized advertisements back to them. Consequently, the Internet Engineering Task 
                    Force recommended both Netscape and Internet Explorer to stop automatically accepting third party cookies,
                    however that effort was unsuccessful. The main concern was that they also gathered the users' age, location, 
                    gender, income, marital status, and health concerns rather than just analytical data about their online behaviour. 
                </p>
                <p>                    
                    So in 2002 Law that enables the user to accept or deny Third-party cookies were made possible by The European Union e-Privacy Directive.
                    And so begin the initiation of blocking third-party cookies as much as possible and allowing 
                    the public to surf the web a bit more freely.
                </p>
