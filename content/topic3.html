                <p>Cookies and sessions are quite useful. But how exactly do they work? <br />Let's find out!</p>

                <h2>How do Cookies & Sessions Work?</h2>
                    <p>Cookies are used for keeping data streamline, matching up with the session that's placed on a server.<br />
                        Websites will ask to accept cookies in order to follow data privacy protection law standards. If you choose to deny 
                        them they won't be used.<br />
                        However, once you accept a cookie, it will gain access to information such as webiste name, browser ID, browsing 
                        habits, time spent on a webiste and more.
                    </p>
                    <!--process of cookies-->
                    <p><strong>Process from Browser to Server</strong><br />
                    They follow a specific order as respresented by the list below:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Browser requests a webiste</li>
                            <li>Server sends cookie with response</li>
                            <li>Browser stores cookie</li>
                            <li>Browser sends cookie with requests</li>
                            <li>Server personalises response</li>
                        </ol>
                    <!--main uses of cookies-->
                    <p>There are 3 main things that they're used for and they are session management, personalisation and tracking.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Session Management:</strong> this is used as a form of identification for the user. 
                            Since the cookies from other websites are independent of each other, session management with cookies allows for them to 
                            be linked. <br />
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Personalisation</strong> by having access to different cookies from different websites, sites are able to target 
                            specific ads towards users which they might enjoy. This is similar to tracking with cookies.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> no, this isn't location tracking, but rather cookies can be used to track items that users have 
                            viewed before in their shopping carts and will curate similar goods which may appeal to them.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
            </section>
            
            <!--where are cookies & sessions used & stored-->
            <section>
                <h2>When are Cookies & Sessions Used & Stored?</h2>
                    <p>Cookies and sessions are used all the time when we are accessing the Internet.<br />
                        
                        Where cookies are stored client side and downloaded onto the HDD of a user's computer and handled by the browser, 
                        most sessions are found on web servers, with a handful being stored on the client side.<br />
                        
                        If sessions are to be stored client side, it means the session information will be able to load faster as it won't have to verify against 
                        sessions on the server. <br />
                        This is often the case when storage required is low, however if more storage space is needed,
                        then the sessions should be stored on the server side.
                    </p>

                <!--who uses cookies and sessions-->
                <h3>Who has Access to Cookies & Sessions?</h3>
                    <p>For the most part, cookies can only be accessed by the website which requested the cookie. <br />
                        However, cookies can make use of a unique ID (a string of characters) which allows for servers being able to match up with the cookie data on the server. <br />
