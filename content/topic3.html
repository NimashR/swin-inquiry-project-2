                <h2>How do Cookies & Sessions Work?</h2>
                    <p class="how-cs-work">
                        Cookies and sessions are useful when surfing the web, but how exactly do they work? 
                        Firstly, we need to start with protcols.

                        To transfer data over the Internet we make use of protocols. In particular HTTPS (hyper-text transfer protocol secure), which by default is a <em>stateless</em> protocol.
                        Cookies and sessions are what make HTTPS a <em>stateful</em> protocol. But what does this mean? 

                        Cookies are used for keeping data streamline, matching up with the session that's placed on a server.
                        Websites will ask to accept cookies in order to follow data privacy protection law standards. If you choose to deny 
                        them they won't be used.

                        However, once you accept a cookie, it will gain access to information such as webiste name, browser ID, browsing 
                        habits, time spent on a webiste and more.
                    </p>

                <h3>The Main use of Cookies:</h3>
                <p>There are 3 main things that they're used for and they are authentication (session management), personalisation and tracking.</p>
                <dl id="3-uses">
                    <dt>Authentication:</dt>

                            <dd>This is used as a form of identification for the user. <br>
                                Since the cookies from other websites are independent of each other, session management with cookies allows for them to be linked.
                            </dd>

                    <dt>Personalisation:</dt>

                                specific ads towards users which they might enjoy. This is similar to tracking with cookies.

            <section id="where-used-stored">
                <h2>When are Cookies & Sessions Used & Stored?</h2>
                    <p>Cookies and sessions are used all the time when we are accessing the Internet.
                        
                        Where cookies are stored client side and downloaded onto the HDD of a user's computer and handled by the browser, 
                        most sessions are found on web servers, with a handful being stored on the client side.
                        They are only able to store a maximum of 4KB of data. 
                    </p>

                    <aside>
                        <p>The ID is usually made up of a string of characters much like a cookie! <br>
                        <p>For example: <code id="cookie-id">A9A3BECE0563982D</code></p>
                    </aside>

                    <p>
                        If sessions are to be stored client side, it means the session information will be able to load faster as it won't have to verify against 
                        sessions on the server. <br/>
                        This is often the case when storage required is low, however if more storage space is needed,
                        then the sessions should be stored on the server side.
                    </p>

                <!--who uses cookies and sessions -->
                <section id="who-access"> 
                    <h3>Who has Access to Cookies & Sessions?</h3>
                        <p>For the most part, cookies can only be accessed by the website which requested the cookie. <br/>
                            However, cookies can make use of a unique ID which allows for servers being able to match up with the cookie data on the server. <br/>
                        </p>

                        <p>This goes more into 3rd party cookies and alternatives to cookies.
